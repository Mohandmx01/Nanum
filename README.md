# Li-ion Cell Dashboard

This Streamlit application provides a dashboard for visualizing data from Li-ion cells. It includes an overview of the State of Health (SoH) for two specific cell IDs and detailed charts for various metrics of each cell.

## Features

- **Overview Page**: Displays a pie chart showing the State of Health (SoH) for two Li-ion cells.
- **Cell Pages**: For each cell ID, displays four charts:
  - **Current Data**: Graph of current vs. time.
  - **Voltage Data**: Graph of voltage vs. time.
  - **Capacity Data**: Graph of capacity vs. time.
  - **Temperature Data**: Graph of temperature vs. time.
  - **Time Data**: Graph of time vs. index.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- **PostgreSQL**: You need a PostgreSQL database with the relevant tables for the cells.
